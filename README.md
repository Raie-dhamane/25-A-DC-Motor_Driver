**DC Motor Driver**

4V-25A  DC Motor driver tested on DSO - Actual PCB - Shoot through issue 

In this project we used two seperate PCB for high voltage and low voltage for security purpose. Those PCB's were in house manifactured and were very basic in design. In our latest model of our motor driver we have made a proper smd-PCB with both high and low voltage part on a single PCB. shoot through issue and deat time issue is there in this project which is solved in our new design.
